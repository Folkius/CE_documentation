# Game additions
## Overview

We use a system of forum posts to add new games to our database or make changes to them. These suggestions are managed through our Discord server.

The following sections are an expanded ruling of what you would find in the forum.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Only users on *C rank* and above can make recommendation posts. 

It is very difficult to be able to talk about values properly when you lack enough reference points, which is why we require C rank to prevent minimal flood. Thread discussions, however, are open to everyone, and when making a thread for anything you should be prepared for this. 
:::

Not everyone is going to always agree with your suggestions or assessment of a games difficulty. It is ultimately up to the mods/reps what happens with recommendations and they will more than likely ask you several clarifying questions before making a decision, as well as pinging other people who may have also played the game in the group, referencing clear times of other people, etc. 

## What can be suggested
You may want to...
- Suggest that a game could be challenging enough for the site (a [potential](#potentials)).
- Suggest a game to be added (a [game addition](#game-additions)).
- Suggest some aspects of the game or an objective to be added, changed, buffed or nerfed (an [adjustment](#adjustments)).
- - If these changes are purely aesthetical (icons, typos, wording, etc), move it to ```#aesthetic-feedback```, which is directly below the recommendations forum It also has more relaxed rules.
- Suggest a removal of a game from the site (a [removal](#removals)).

## Behavior notes (global)
These apply for EVERY type of thread that you can make.
- Check if the game wasn't talked about already. You could be repeating past history.
- Be sure to reply to any questions regarding the game if you know the answer.
- The post will likely need to be active for at least one full day before any action is taken on your recommendation to allow some time for others to contribute. **Do not hurry the mods**, they're all volunteers and doing their best to curate a good addition/change. If it has been a full week without activity you may bump it up again if needed.
- While discussing (and this applies to all post members), try to not deviate the theme too much. Focus on discussion and don't turn it into a sticker flood or simple progress thread.
- Mods reserve the right to lock and ignore threads if needed.


## Potentials

Everything starts from somewhere. There are tens of thousands of games on Steam and not everyone knows what secrets they hide in-between.
If you see any game that has hints of being challenging enough for our site (either because you tried it, or it has low% achievements, or there are secrets you saw in a stream, or whatever else) and wasn't added to the site yet, you can suggest it as a potential for someone else to check it.

You just have to list the achievements or in-game feats the game has, which would make it a decent candidate for inclusion.


### Other notes
- Check that the game isn't listed already as a potential ([Potential list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=1693629618))
- Check that the game isn't in the rejected list ([Rejection list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=664460343))

## Game additions

include the tier, category, and point estimate for the game along with the suggested objectives and which achievements / in game feats should be included. Optionally, you're free to include a suggested name and icon along with each objective.,

### Details to consider
- You must have completed ALL or AT LEAST ONE relevant challenge/objective in for your suggestion to be valid. This is meant both as a confirmation that you know about the game and its value, and because otherwise it's no different than suggesting it for potentials.
- Check that the game isn't in the rejected list ([Rejection list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=664460343)). If it is, then check its rejection date and the reason. If you're confident that the circumstances have changed or it's been wrongly classified, you may proceed.


### Games that WILL be rejected
Regardless of difficulty, we don't allow these games:
- Asset spams (definition up to the staff),
- Ludicrously expensive games (>200 USD on base game alone, for example, or if thousands of pricey DLCs),
- Delisted games (exceptions made if keys are easily available),
- Games with terrible performance (frequent crashes for everyone).

Games on Early Access are subject to some scrutiny. It'd be better if their core gameplay loop is finished or abandoned, otherwise they may be left on hold.

Games that have online-only content are allowed too, but your points are not guaranteed to stay if it's taken down.

### More
- If you are recommending a low tier 1 game, consider trying one of the free games from the respective category as a point of comparison. These games are free and generally at the lower end of the point of entry for a game on the list. Make sure you are confident the game you are suggesting is harder than the ones listed below.,

Flem (platformer) | Laserboy (action) | Neon Boost (First Person) | Prologue for a Vacant Kingdom (Bullet Hell) | Project Rhombus (Arcade),

Some other well known titles that are low tier entry point comparisons would be: Heads Run, Hotline Miami, Clustertruck, Marimoth, oO, Boson X.,
