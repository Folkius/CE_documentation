# Game additions
## Overview

We use a system of forum posts to add new games to our database or make changes to them. These suggestions are managed through our Discord server.

The following sections are an expanded ruling of what you would find in the forum.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Only users on *C rank* and above can make recommendation posts. 

It is very difficult to be able to talk about values properly when you lack enough reference points, which is why we require C rank to prevent minimal flood. Thread discussions, however, are open to everyone, and when making a thread for anything you should be prepared for this. 
:::

Not everyone is going to always agree with your suggestions or assessment of a games difficulty. It is ultimately up to the mods/reps what happens with recommendations and they will more than likely ask you several clarifying questions before making a decision, as well as pinging other people who may have also played the game in the group, referencing clear times of other people, etc. 

## Behavior notes (global)
These apply for EVERY type of thread that you can make.
- Check if the game wasn't talked about already. You could be repeating past history.
- Be sure to reply to any questions regarding the game if you know the answer.
- The post will likely need to be active for at least one full day before any action is taken on your recommendation to allow some time for others to contribute. **Do not hurry the mods**, they're all volunteers and doing their best to curate a good addition/change. If it has been a full week without activity you may bump it up again if needed.
- While discussing (and this applies to all post members), try to not deviate the theme of the thread too much. Focus on discussion and don't turn it into a sticker flood or simple progress thread.
- Mods reserve the right to lock and ignore threads if needed.

## What can be suggested
You may want to...
- Suggest that a game could be challenging enough for the site (a [potential](#potentials)).
- Suggest a game to be added (a [game addition](#game-additions)).
- Suggest some aspects of the game or an objective to be added, changed, buffed or nerfed (an [adjustment](#adjustments)).
- - If these changes are purely aesthetical (icons, typos, wording, etc), move it to ```#aesthetic-feedback```, which is directly below the recommendations forum It also has more relaxed rules.
- Suggest a removal of a game from the site (a [removal](#removals)).


## Potentials

Everything starts from somewhere. There are tens of thousands of games on Steam and not everyone knows what secrets they hide in-between.
If you see any game that has hints of being challenging enough for our site (either because you tried it, or it has low% achievements, or there are secrets you saw in a stream, or whatever else) and wasn't added to the site yet, you can suggest it as a potential for someone else to check it.

You just have to list the achievements or in-game feats the game has, which would make it a decent candidate for inclusion.

### Other notes
- Check that the game isn't listed already as a potential ([Potential list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=1693629618))
- Check that the game isn't rejected because of anything ([Rejection list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=664460343))

## Game additions

This is the basis from the site is built upon.

A game is a candidate for being added as long as the game presents enough challenge to meet at least the Tier 1 threshold

include the tier, category, and point estimate for the game along with the suggested objectives and which achievements / in game feats should be included. Optionally, you're free to include a suggested name and icon along with each objective.

### Details to consider
- You must have completed ALL or AT LEAST ONE relevant challenge/objective in the game for your suggestion to be valid. This is meant both as a confirmation that you know about the game and its value, and because otherwise it's no different than suggesting it for potentials.
- Check that the game isn't in the rejected list ([Rejection list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=664460343)). If it is, then check its rejection date and the reason. If you're confident that the circumstances have changed or it's been wrongly classified, you may proceed.

### Games that WILL be rejected
Regardless of difficulty, we don't allow these games:
- Asset spams (definition up to the staff);
- Ludicrously expensive games (>200 USD on base game alone, for example, or if thousands of pricey DLCs);
- Delisted games (exceptions made if keys are easily available);
- Games with terrible performance (frequent crashes for everyone);
- Direct duplicates (unless replacing delisted games);
- Game existing outside of the paradigm of what's accepted by the categories (puzzles, PvP games, idlers, etc.)

Games on Early Access are subject to some scrutiny. It'd be better if **their core gameplay loop is finished or abandoned**, otherwise they may be left on hold.

Games that have online-only content are allowed too, but your points are not guaranteed to stay if they're taken down.

### Extras
 If you are recommending a low Tier 1 game (5 points total), consider trying one of the free games from the respective category as a point of comparison. These games are free and generally at the lower end of the point of entry for a game on the list. Make sure you are confident the game you are suggesting is harder than the ones listed below.

Flem (platformer) | Laserboy (action) | Neon Boost (First Person) | Prologue for a Vacant Kingdom (Bullet Hell) | Project Rhombus (Arcade) | Peggle Extreme (Strategy)

Some other well known titles that are low tier entry point comparisons would be: Heads Run, Hotline Miami, Clustertruck, Marimoth, oO, Boson X.

## Adjustments

An "adjustment" is a broad term which includes any kind of non-aesthetic changes to a game that already exists on the site, excluding removals which have a separate category.

There are several reasons you would want to make an adjustment to a game. Some of the most common examples:
- A game has added challenging content in an update/DLC and you don't see it being included here;
- You think some achievements are unnecesary to have, or have been nerfed too much to be worth a challenge;
- An objective could have a different type of proof required due to any circumstances;
- You have a proposal regarding point values, etcetera.

The general rules still apply: talking about point values in any non-speculative manner would require you to clear a relevant objective for the game.


## Removals

A removal is a term used to put a game into our [Rejection list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=664460343). It can be done for potential games, or for any random games you can find on Steam/RA. It's more commonly used to paramount for removing games from our site, though.

Removals sound scary. They're certainly not a positive thing to bring up in any case. And in the case of site removals, they're rather rare so it has to be justified.

There are various reasons to call for a site removal:
- The game has gone through a massive overhaul, and none of the available challenges are worth a minimum anymore;
- There's a core gameplay mechanic that's commonly used that trivializes all challenges present (this is subjective and may still be saved by "Tier 1 leniency" depending on the case);
- The game is extremely inconsistent for no reason and/or suffers from serious quality issues (random consistent crashes, extreme jank);
- The game is directly not playable anymore (do not confuse with delisted games, which are a separate matter).

You must have played through the game enough for your removal to be valid for analysis, otherwise it will be ignored.

### Process for game removal

If a user feels strongly that a game listed on the site does not meet the difficulty threshold to be included on the site, the process to instigate a review is as follows.

Open a thread in ⁠```#recommendations``` titled ```Removal: [GAME NAME]```, and link the CE game page in the initial post along with tagging the ```@Rep``` role. (TBD)

Include pertinent details as to why the game did not feel sufficiently difficult. In all cases, please provide an indication of play time, and then further commentary. For example:
- "The PO(s) took me 10h - the time spent was high, but there was effectively no difficulty"
- "Suggesting removal for quality reasons - the PO is only possible with a registry edit" [or other reasoning]
- "The game only took me an hour, and whilst there some level of challenge, it wasn't enough to be on the site imo"
- "The PO(s) took me 2h - An update was made to the game that rebalanced the game, making it too easy"

From there, the Rep(s) will seek further feedback, according to this general guidance:
- If there a low number of clearers, all clearers to be pinged and asked for input (hours, perspective on the level of challenge, etc)
- If there a high number of clearers, active users may be pinged for input initially. If there a general consensus, no further pings to be required.

The number of clearers to ping will be at the discretion of the Rep handling the matter, but shouldn't be less than 10-20% of the total number.
 
The next step will require a level of judgement, but may take one of several forms:
- Game removal/maintenance if there broad consensus on that outcome
- Seeking further input from clearers not pinged initially, if there a sufficient user base
- Application of the "Site Eligibility Under Dispute" information tag the game should there be limited available input, or conflicting viewpoints
  - The thread will remain open, and further input from new clearers will be required.
  - The number of new clearers' input should be informed by the user base (eg: a game with 3 clearers may only need 1 additional user's input, whilst a game with 50 might require 3)
