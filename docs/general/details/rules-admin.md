# CE Website

The use of the CE Website (TBD - link) is predicated on adherence to the rules as set out below.

## Rules - CE Website

1. Objectives (TBD - link to the objectives page) registered with the CE Website on a user's profile need to have been legitimately obtained (i.e. not earned through use of cheats, external programs, through another user playing on your account, etc).  

   {1.1} Should objectives have been earned on the CE Website arising from previous instances of cheating (or similar), continued use of the CE Website is permitted only if a TICKET (TBD - LINK) is raised with the Moderation team, identifying impacted games/objectives. The Moderation team will look to work with you to rectify your CE profile.  
   
   {1.2} Where this process is not followed, if your account is identified as having obtained objectives illegitimately, your profile will be flagged as Removed (TBD - intra-link to the below section), and you will not appear on any leaderboard.

2. A user's username and display picture cannot contain offensive, NSFW, derogatory or defamatory content.
   Your CE user page name and avatar are based on those present on Steam as at the time of last profile synchronisation.

### Leaderboard Removal

A ```Removed``` flag is applied to profiles that have been identified as using illegitimate means for earning objectives on the CE Website.

Profiles with this flag applied will not appear on leaderboards, and their individual game completions will not appear on game pages.

### Leaderboard Exclusion

The CE team recognise that users may choose to interact with challenge-focused gaming with different motivations.

For those that wish to continue utilising the CE Website, but do not wish to have their profile appear on leaderboards, they may apply through the Moderation team (see: Raising a ticket (TBD LINK)) to have their profile marked with the ```Excluded``` flag.

The process to have this flag applied is involved, and should be considered a permanent change to one's profile.

Profiles with this flag applied will not appear on leaderboards, and their individual game completions will not appear on game pages. (TBD - DISCUSSION RE THE GAME COMPLETION PAGE)

# CE Discord

The use of the CE Discord (TBD - permanent link) is predicated on good faith engagement with other community members, and adherence to the rules as set out below.

Throughout the sections below we use ```'the community'``` to refer to those interacting with CE through the Discord server (```CE Discord``` or ```the server```).

## Rules - CE Discord

1) No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other similar forms of discriminatory behaviour.  
We accept **any** person who seeks out challenging gaming content, subject to adherence to our rules and principles, and hateful or derogatory comments that would make others feel unwelcome are not accepted within the community.

2) No illegal, harmful, or NSFW content (including links to sites that have these things)

    {2.1} While discussion of piracy is not explicitly disallowed, the sharing of copyrighted content is prohibited on the server. This includes, but is not limited to, uploading files within Discord, or linking to websites where said copyrighted content may be obtained without appropriate compensation to the author(s).

3) No humble bragging, elitism, or downplaying of others' accomplishments.  

4) Do not promote, normalise, or glorify cheating, nor the use of cheating software at all.  
We are a challenge seeking community, and actively aiming to circumvent the legitimate completion of challenges, or encourage this behaviour, is not aligned with our core values. 

5) Be honest and transparent in regards to your own gaming accomplishments.  
This includes transparency of when 'cheese' is used in a game, where Steam-reported (or other platform-reported) play time is not accurate, where external help may have been enlisted, or where accomplishments have been obtained through illegitimate means.
	
	{5.1} A user's activity prior to joining CE, including the use of SAM or other cheating software, does not exclude a user's ability to engage with the community, subject to their adhering to ```Rule (TBD)``` in the CE Website section above.  
	The use of cheating software, or other means of illegitimately obtaining objectives on CE, while being part of this community is not accepted, and will result in a ban from the leaderboards.
	
    {5.2} If you notice suspicious activity, do not call out or attack the user in question publicly.  
    Please raise a ticket (see: ```#support```) with the Mod team, who will be happy to discuss with you and/or investigate further, as required.

6) We require all users to follow the Discord Community Guidelines when engaging with the server: https://discord.com/guidelines  
Further to these guidelines, the below points are to be followed when utilising the CE discord:

    {6.1} Public discussion of what users you have blocked and/or have blocked you, unless strictly required to clarify a misunderstanding, is prohibited.
	
    {6.2} Regular/ongoing messages with negative sentiment directed towards one's self are not allowed. Whilst people are generally happy to offer support insofar as possible, the server is not a place for seeking professional self-help advice.
	
    {6.3} Messages suggesting suicidal ideation, whether intended only as a joke or otherwise, are not permitted.

7) The CE Discord is an English language server, so you're encouraged to communicate in English within the server.  
Messages in other languages aren't prohibited, but sustained conversation in a language other than English is not allowed; all members should be able to follow conversation.  
Please take conversation to Direct Messages if another language is the preferred means of communication.  

    {7.1} (日本語) CEに参加している日本人が集まった派生サーバーがあります。  
	サーバーやサイトの仕組みでも、ゲームの攻略でも、なにかしら質問等がある場合はこちらで聞いてみると良いかもしれません。  

### Discord rule enforcement

If a message is deemed to be offending, relative to the rules set out above, it may be deleted/removed.  
Depending on the nature and circumstances of the message, the user may be warned either informally or formally.

Should server rules be broken frequently, a formal warning will be issued, with repeat offences resulting in 'Q Rank' being applied.  
The 'Q Rank' role has restricted permissions, effectively acting as a temporary server-wide mute that prevents posting in text channels. The duration of the 'Q Rank' role's application will be at the discretion of the moderator handling the matter, and should take into account the nature and regularity of rule breaking.

After having been warned and/or had the 'Q Rank' role applied, a consistently-demonstrated inability to follow the server rules and guidelines can lead to a ban from the server.

## Community Guiding Principles

Separate to the rules that apply to the use of the CE Discord server, as set out above, we have listed below the principles that are at the core of our community moderation practices, and the values of the CE administrators.

1. The server should be a place where users' gaming accomplishments are celebrated, whether big or small, and frustrations expressed en route to success are responded to in a supportive and uplifting manner.  

2. All community members should feel safe and comfortable being present within the community.  
   To the extent this is not the case, we welcome users to raise a Moderator or Admin ticket, as deemed appropriate by the user raising the ticket.
  
3. How a user engages outside of the CE community is not in itself grounds for removal from the CE community.  
   There may, however, be repercussions to the extent that this outside engagement could be reasonably argued to:  
   - Impact the safety and well-being of users engaging as part of the CE community; or
   - Impact negatively on the public's perception of CE and/or its community.

4. A user's historical actions do not inherently predicate future actions of a similar nature.
   Subject to the above guiding principles and rules being maintained, there should always be an avenue to reconciliation and reinstatement into the community.  
   Banned users seeking reinstatement should (TBD -- CONTACT METHOD HERE).
