# Edge-Cases, Exceptions, etc
-----------------------------
As you would expect with a system that is based around so many subjective things, things aren't always as clean-cut as one might like.

## Assist/Cheats/DevConsole 
Many games nowadays include "accessibility" options as well as assist modes, cheat codes, etc. Basically things that make the game easier than what is often viewed as the "normal play experience". We have different rules regarding these options depending on the Tier of the game. For T1 games, we simply value the games assuming they are played "as intended". For T2+ games we simply require video/screenshot proof showing these options weren't used. In cases where these features exist but they have a relatively minor impact on the challenges of the game, then they are assumed to be used to their full extent and are just valued accordingly.

## Cheating 
Separate from in-game cheating. This includes any kind of file manipulation within game folders. Either editing files or copying save files in order to trivialize a challenge. As well as using any programs which can be used to unlock achievements without actually doing them, play a game in slow motion, etc. This is in general disallowed, and if you are found to have done it there may be severe consequences.

::: tip Past Cheating
CE recognises that users go through many phases in life, and may have cheated achievements (or similar) in the past for a number of reasons.

It is expected that anyone looking to engage with the CE community and website will proactively identify to CE Staff (see: << TICKET SYSTEM >> ) instances where past actions have impacted the integrity of their CE profile (eg: achievements unlocked using external programs).

No 'black mark' will be placed on your CE account, and CE staff will advise on the best course of action to bring the user's CE profile back into good standing.

## Proof Requirements 
If an objective does not specify a video/screenshot proof, then you simply need to click "update" on the website. You will be given the objective automatically if you have the achievements required.

For T4+ games, even if a game lacks any in-game methods of "cheating", we often require video proof of challenges when/where it is reasonable to do so. In some cases you may get partial points for having the achievements and then require proof in order to get the full value of the objective.

## Guides & Puzzle Games 
It goes without saying that guides can massively effect the difficulty of games and skew expected playtimes. In general, all games are valued assuming guides are used. This is necessary in order to even the playing field and simplify the process of valuing games. As a consequence, puzzle games are not currently valued on the site at all, though they do exist in their own little ecosystem here: https://cedb.me/game/27578157-10b2-4f29-acee-452c2dc59477 

There are cases where puzzle games are valued on the site. EX: The Witness, Portal, Braid. However these games are not valued for the puzzle solving element of the game and only for the portion of the game that can not be fully trivialized by a guide. This often includes some form of randomization or a speedrun/deathless challenge of some kind.

## Dev-Intention 
While being obvious in the majority of cases, in all edge-cases where it isn't clear what is dev intended for the purposes of cheating or determining if something qualifies as a Primary Objective, it is left up to the mods/reps. If the objective doesn't specify, then it is probably allowed. If you aren't sure, then ask.

## PVP challenges 
Dev intended or not, we do not add dynamic or PvP related challenges to the website. Their variable nature makes them impossible to value, especially in relation to single-player challenges.
