# Other considerations
-----------------------------
As you would expect with a system that is based upon many different processes and structures, there are sometimes components that aren't purely black or white.

## Accessibility Options

Many games nowadays include "accessibility" options as well as assist modes, cheat codes, etc. Basically things that make the game easier than what is often viewed as the "normal play experience". We have different rules regarding these options depending on the Tier of the game. 

For T1 games, we simply value the games assuming they are played "as intended". This is the concept of "Tier 1 Leniency". 

For T2+ games we simply require video/screenshot proof showing these options weren't used. In cases where these features exist but they have a relatively minor impact on the challenges of the game, then they are assumed to be used to their full extent and are just valued accordingly.


## Cheating 
Separate from in-game cheating using dev-provided cheat codes or accessibility options.

Cheating can encompass any of the following from a CE perspective:
- any kind of file manipulation within game folders
- editing files or copying save files in order to trivialize a challenge
- down-patching to previous versions of a game which make achievements easier (eg: to a previous version where achievements could be earned with accessibility options enabled)
   - this is not to be confused with down-patching to enable/fix broken achievements
- the use of any external programs to trivialize a challenge, whether unlocking achievements without actually doing them, playing a game in slow motion, etc.

Effectively, any action that may lead to an objective on the site being earned without having accomplished it in good faith.

CE operate on the assumption that these kinds of foul play are not utilised. If you are found to have cheated it there may be severe consequences.

::: tip Past Cheating
CE recognises that users go through many phases in life, and may have cheated achievements (or similar) in the past for a number of reasons.

It is expected that anyone looking to engage with the CE community and website will proactively identify to CE Staff (see: [Contacting Mods/Admins](/general/ticketing) ) instances where past actions have impacted the integrity of their CE profile (eg: achievements unlocked using external programs).

No 'black mark' will be placed on your CE account, and CE staff will advise on the best course of action to bring the user's CE profile back into good standing.

::: danger Active Cheating
Any user found to be cheating will go through a process of being returned to E-rank and removed from the leaderboards. This may not be permanent if actions are taken to acknowledge and reverse the cheated games via an appeal ticket in our Discord server, but said user will be subject to more scrutiny during an unspecified period of time.

Each user only has a chance to appeal once for active cheating, and if repeated they will be permanently removed from the leaderboards.

## Proof Requirements 

For high value games, even if a game lacks any in-game methods of "cheating" (accessibility options, exploits, or otherwise), we often require video proof of challenges when/where it is reasonable to do so. In some cases you may get partial points for having the achievements and then require proof in order to get the full value of the objective.

## Guides & Puzzle Games 
It goes without saying that guides can massively effect the difficulty of games and skew expected playtimes. In general, all games are valued assuming guides are used. This is necessary in order to even the playing field and simplify the process of valuing games. As a consequence, puzzle games are not currently valued on the site at all, though they do exist in their own little ecosystem here: https://cedb.me/game/27578157-10b2-4f29-acee-452c2dc59477 

There are cases where puzzle games are valued on the site. EX: The Witness, Portal, Braid. However these games are not valued for the puzzle solving element of the game and only for the portion of the game that can not be fully trivialized by a guide. This often includes some form of randomization or a speedrun/deathless challenge of some kind.

## Dynamic / PvP challenges 

Developer-intended or not, we do not add dynamic or PvP-related challenges to the website. Their variable nature makes them impossible to value, as there is no consistent experience against which to assess the level of challenge / difficulty.

This may arise in the form of:

- Reaching the top "x" ranks, or top "y%" of scores on an in-game leaderboard.
- Challenges where the developer commits to adjusting the difficulty over time.
- Defeating someone with a particular rank, or a certain number of opponents, in a PvP setting.
