For each game on the CE website, a minimum of one tag will be found on the game page.

## Interacting with tags

On the main games page, it is expected that the user will be able to apply filters to games, similar to how games can be filtered by [Tier](/general/details/points-tiers#tiers) or [Category](/general/details/categories).

This may be used to help identify:
- a particular subset of games in a given category (eg: Foddian games within the Platformer catgory)
- games that contribute to certain [Site Achievements](/general/details/site-achievements) (identified through Information tags)
- games that are no longer able to be purchased through Steam
- various other categorisations!


## Genre tags

Genre tags are not pulled from Steam / RetroAchievements, but rather will be managed by the community.

They don't really have strict definitions like the categories, and are meant to help filter the site further into the types of games that a user might be interested in or looking for.

Each of the tags will come with new site achievements, leaderboards, and roles.

The current list of supported genres, and a brief description, are detailed below:
