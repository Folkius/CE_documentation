# Bounty Hub

The Bounty Hub (```#bounty-hub``` on the CE Discord) is a central place for users to interact with bounties placed on CE-related feats.

## What are bounties?

Bounties come in five types:
1. **Potentials** bounties are not currently on the site, and have been identified as being potentially difficult enough to add
2. **Uncleared** bounties are games that have an objective that has yet to be completed by a CE member
3. **Low Clear** bounties are games that have been completed by less than 3 people (5 in some cases)
4. **Retro** bounties are games that are found on RetroAchievements and work differently (See below)
5. **Unlisted** bounties are games that are not listed on any sheet, and are always worth a static 1 bounty point. (See below)

### Where to find the current bounties

Potentials, Uncleared, and Low Clear bounties [can be found on this Google sheet document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit?gid=1411221997#gid=1411221997).

Retro bounties [can be found on this Google sheet document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g_7GlGYtz0l4EV_WfWdhslcfYcUZph2-8G4lbHvF214/edit?gid=645512564#gid=645512564), under the "Potentials" tab.

### Retro and Unlisted bounties

Bounties listed under the "Potentials" tab of the Retro sheet may increment in value over time, however any game on the sheet listed as a "-1" or "0" will grant 1 point for confirming (by playing) that it has no PO or SO capable challenges, and moving the status to "-2".

If you add a game to the site and it's not on any list, you may earn 1 bounty point as long as you link to your thread in ```#the-saloon```.

## What are Bounty Seasons?

Bounty seasons are 3 month blocks of time in which the highest earner over the course of the three month period will earn the ```Champion``` (green role) title, a $25 steam gift card, and a key from the key list.

Bounty seasons may have unique modifiers that give a different feel to each next season.

You can see the current season in this hub by looking for a forum titled "CE Bounty Season" in ```#⁠bounty-hub```.

## What are Bounty Points?

Bounty points are the value assigned to "claiming" a given bounty. These would typically come from the current "CE Bounty Season", but community bounties (/general/details/bounty#community-bounties) can also offer Bounty Points as a reward (pending admin approval).

Within a given season's list of bounty games:
- Bounty points start at a value of 1, and increase over time
- Every Saturday, for each category 10 random bounties increase by 1 point, as well as 1 uncleared bounty by 5 points

Users' bounty points are [tracked on a leaderboard](https://discord.com/channels/639112509445505044/1191585319179522208/1192474817606193313) within ```#the-mercantile``` on the CE Discord.

Bounty points can be spent in [The Mercantile Shop](https://discord.com/channels/639112509445505044/1191585319179522208/1192341595371085874) for Game Keys, Steam Gift Cards, unique roles, Casino related benefits, and other things.

In addition, there are a number of [Site Achievements](/general/details/site-achievements) that can be earned through participation in the Bounty Hub. There are various bounty-related achievements, including:
- Claiming each of the five types of bounties
- Claiming multiple bounties within a given Season
- Reaching lifetime-earned Bounty Points thresholds
- Posting your own bounty (see the relevant section below)
- Claiming a community bounty

## Participating in bounty hunting

You can chat about general bounty related topics in ```#the-saloon```.

You must be ```C Rank``` or higher to claim a bounty and earn points.

To claim a **Potentials** bounty:
- You only need to complete enough of the challenges in the game that would be worth at least 5 points so that the game may be added to the site, however, you MUST detail all possible challenges in the game, including those you did not do. When this happens, the game begins to *Retire*.
   - A *Retiring* bounty is one that has been claimed, and will be removed from the bounty lists one month from when it was claimed. Anyone who would claim the bounty in that time are awarded half the value of the bounty.
- You may also claim a **Potentials** bounty by confirming that the game has no PO or SO capable challenges, or determining that it is too easy to add to the site.

To claim an **Uncleared** bounty:
- You need to complete one of the objectives for the game that are listed as "UNCLEARED", once this happens, if there are any remaining "UNCLEARED" objectives for the game, the value of the Uncleared bounty is reset to 5, otherwise the bounty retires immediately.

To claim a **Low-Clear** bounty:
- You must complete all POs for the game.

If you are claiming a bounty, make a recommendation thread as though you were normally recommending a game be [added to the site](/general/details/adding-games) and simply link your recommendation thread in either the current season's thread, or in ```#the-saloon```.

## Community bounties

Beyond the CE-hosted bounty activity through Seasons, users with at least ```C Rank``` are able to post their own bounties within the Bounty Hub (in ```#bounty-hub```).

Bounties could be posted for:
- Completing an UNCLEARED objective
- Scouting out potential games
- Streaming a successful run of an already-completed games
- Developing a comprehensive guide for a CE game
- Most anything else, as long as it relates to CE

These bounties could be set with rewards in the form of:
- Monetary rewards
- Bounty points (requires approval from Jarvis)
- Cute pics of your pet
- Other rewards as you see fit (but please keep it PG13...)

Past bounties have included scouting out Sega Genesis potentials, for completing Deathless Dungeon (a 1.5h YOLO), Speedrun bounties in Celaria, traditional Rogue-likes (ADOM, and Rogue).
