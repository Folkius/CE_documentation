# Puzzle Games

Puzzle games by their very nature of being static and wholly guideable are not suited for being on the site; every user's ability to open a guide and successfully complete the game does not represent a 'challenge', and therefore cannot be recognised with [points](/general/details/points-tiers).

CE does, however, recognise that engaging with puzzle games the way they were designed (that is, without using a guide) can be an exceptionally challenging experience. As such, we wanted to ensure there a way to recognise these games on the site.

## The Puzzle Games site entry

The place where puzzle games are acknowledged on the site is in the entry:  
[- Puzzle Games -](https://cedb.me/game/27578157-10b2-4f29-acee-452c2dc59477)

This page serves as a list of puzzle games on Steam curated by CE. Each game listed will require you to either complete all/specific achievements in the game, or complete all in-game puzzles offered.

The difficulty of these games are ranked on a three-tier system, which is voted on by Discord participants:
- Moderate (🟨)
- Challenging (🟥)
- Extreme (⬛)

A specialized potentials list for puzzle games can be found [at this Google sheet document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZBGDmftR_tbJ1WuoNnF6UKNpVpXaO7gwg1EQlZQlfc/edit?gid=68611425#gid=68611425). Games are added to this list through a voting system within the CE Discord server—if you wish to participate in that, ask any of the Discord mods for the "@Puzzle Enthusiast" role.

To be eligible for these achievements, please add the associated game "Frame of Mind" to your library, and then update your profile. You should show up in the full completions after a while, and can then post your proof.  
Please remember that the objectives on this page do not count toward CO-related roles.
