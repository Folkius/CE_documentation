::: warning Role hierarchy
Within each category, higher threshold roles/titles will replace the one below it once achieved.  
i.e. It is not possible to hold both Action Expert and Action Master; Master will replace Expert.
:::



In addition to the titles/roles above, there are a number of titles/roles that relate to category-specific requirements.

| Title / Role | Requirement | Colour |
| :----------- | :---- | :---- |
| Master of All | 500+ points in all categories simultaneously | Orange |

| Overpowered | 3,000 or more points in a single category | Red |
| Omnipotent | Complete\* a T4+ game in each category | Red |
| Omnipotent | Complete\* a T5 game in each category | Black |
| Sage of the Six Paths | See [Special Titles](#special-titles-roles) | White |

\* A game is considered 'completed' when all Primary Objectives are earned.

Should a game have Secondary Objectives, and the point values from completed Secondary Objectives increase a user's earned points in a game above a given Tier threshold, the game will count towards the higher tier.

::: tip Title / Role retention
Once awarded, titles/roles from this section cannot be lost.  
For example, if a game's value is later reduced and you fall below 2000 points in a category, the 'Grandmaster' title/role will be maintained.
