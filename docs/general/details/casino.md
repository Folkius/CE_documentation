# Casino

One of the features of the site, accessible only through Discord, is the ability to participate in one of several pre-defined "Casino Rolls".

The moniker 'casino' comes from a game, or list of games, being randomly rolled for the user.

There is no gambling of real world currency involved, but there is a notional ```Casino Score``` (**CS**) which can be earned through completing rolls.  
For many rolls, there is a CS cost associated with non-completion (in the case of timed rolls), or with re-rolling (in the case of rolls without time limits). 

A user's first completion of each of which awards a corresponding [Site Achievement](/general/details/site-achievements).  
A user may also choose to undertake a given roll multiple times, to increase their CS (or for the fun of it!).

Details on how to access the casino rolls are [set out in full at the end](/general/details/casino#accessing-casino-rolls).

A list of the available solo rolls, their criteria, the casino score bonuses/costs, and cooldowns on re-rolling are set out below. 

## Solo rolls - Time-limited

::: info COOLDOWNS
For timed rolls, the listed cooldown only comes into effect if a roll is not completed within the listed timeframe.  

Should a given roll be completed, a user can choose to roll again immediately if desired.

## Accessing Casino rolls

The [CE Assistant Bot](general/ce-bots.html#casino-rolls) is the way to access these Casino rolls, within the ```#casino``` channel of the CE Discord.

Using the ```/solo-roll``` command, a user can select from any of the below-listed solo rolls.

![Solo1](/casino/casino01.png)

Any roll can be selected, but the roll will only commence if the pre-requisites are met; an error will be returned if you select an ineligible roll.

Two additional parameters may be set by the user:

![Solo2](/casino/casino04.png)

Each of the rolls have a default 'maximum price' and 'maximum hours to complete' parameters. These are set to not make the casino too financially onerous, or the roll impractical to complete if there is a time limit.  
If the user doesn't want price, or time to complete, to be a restriction on the roll, they can enter ```False``` in either of the parameters.

Similarly, co-operative rolls can be accessed using the ```/coop-roll``` command.

![Co-op1](/casino/casino02.png)

In the case of co-operative rolls, you will also need to select your partner - they will then be pinged to confirm they wish to participate in the roll.
