# Categories
-----------
Categories are meant to house games of loosely similar style and genre, of which there are currently 6.

## Arcade 
Games with a focus on reflex or score attack, though also includes everything else that isn't covered by the other categories. Some genres that are common to this category include reflex-checks, rhythm, sports, racing, awkward control simulators, and other miscellaneous sub-genres. You can also consider this category to be “Other”.

EX: Super Hexagon, OlliOlli, Surgeon Simulator

## Action
Heavily focuses on a sophisticated combat system, or frequent engagement with enemies and bosses. These might include traditional 2-d fighting games, brawlers, beat’em’ups, souls-like, boss-rush, rogue-likes, and other combat heavy games.
 
EX: Dark Souls, Hades, Cuphead

## Bullet Hell 
Games where avoidance of large amounts of projectiles or moving hazards is the most relevant aspect of the game. This includes traditional arcade shoot ’em ups, 2-d avoidance games, and some twin-stick games, among others.

EX: Touhou (series), Geometry Wars 3, Star of Providence

## First-Person 
Games from the first person perspective, where your movement is unchained. Some common genres in this category are first-person shooters, and first-person movement games.

(As a common misunderstanding, VR games are **not** First-Person by default).

EX: Doom Eternal, Neon White, Devil Daggers

## Platformer 
Primary element of gameplay is precisely maneuvering your way through a kind of obstacle course (almost always primarily by jumping, or an equivalent). These might include traditional 2-d platformers, 3-d platformers, fangames, auto-runners and 2-d grapplers, among others.

EX: Super Meat Boy, Crash Bandicoot, Jump King

## Strategy 
Games with a strong focus on tactical thinking. This includes turn-based games, resource management, RTS, deck-builders, tower defense, traditional roguelikes, randomized puzzles, and more.

EX: Slay the Spire, FTL: Faster Than Light, Peggle Deluxe
