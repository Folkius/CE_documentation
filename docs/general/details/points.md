# Points

Points are the main metric used in the site. They are represented by a gray star :star:. They are used for categorizing games into tiers, grouping users into ranks

Points can only be earned from obtaining primary or secondary objectives in games.

Games are given a set amount of points for their overall difficulty, then spread out across primary and secondary objectives.

Points in objectives use a linear ladder in steps of 5. The higher an objective is valued, the higher its difficulty is estimated to be.

::: info NOTE
Points aren't necessarily a full reflection of the objectives' normal effort - multiple circumstances are taken into account, such as variety of challenges, multiplier penalty applied for T6s and T7s, intensity, amount of objectives done beforehand, content/filler, etc.

### Point quirks

Every game has up to 15 points that can be used in the context of "T1 Leniency" even if the game itself isn't a T1.

## CR Rating 
This is a leaderboard-specific weighted point system. The formula for CR works as follows: 

```Î£(0, n): (0.9^n)(m)``` 

where **n** is the ordering of your games by value (your highest game is considered the 0th highest, and no penalty is applied), and **m** is the value of the game. 

CR is calculated separately for each category. Your first person games do not affect the calculation for platformers, for example. Your overall CR is the combined total of the CR for all 6 categories. The maximum amount a game can contribute to CR is 1000, any game worth more than 1000 points will be assumed to be worth 1000 points for the rating.
