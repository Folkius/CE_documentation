## CR Rating 
This is a leaderboard specific weighted point system. The formula for CR works as follows: 

```Î£(0, n): (0.95^n)(m)``` 

where **n** is the ordering of your games by value (your highest game is considered the 0th highest, and no penalty is applied), and **m** is the value of the game. 

CR is calculated separately for each category. Your first person games do not affect the calculation for platformers, for example. Your overall CR is the combined total of the CR for all 6 categories. The maximum amount a game can contribute to CR is 1000, any game worth more than 1000 points will be assumed to be worth 1000 points for the rating.
