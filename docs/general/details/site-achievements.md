Some information may be present in the 'proof requirement' for each achievement, so it would be best to corroborate with the Site Achievements game page.

#### Instructions to link the underlying game

To be eligible for these achievements, please follow the below instructions:

1. Download the game "[A CHALLENGE](http://store.steampowered.com/app/613920)", which is linked to the Site Achievements page on the site.

2. You might need to download ```Steam 360 Video Player```, which should already be in your Steam library under the "Tools" section, and run that first.

3. Launch "A CHALLENGE" for a few minutes so it shows in your 'recently played' games list on your Steam profile.

4. Update your CE profile - the site should should then associate your the page with your CE profile.
