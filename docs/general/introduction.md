# Introduction

[[toc]]

## Edge-Cases, Exceptions, etc
-----------------------------
As you would expect with a system that is based around so many subjective things, things aren't always as clean-cut as one might like.

- Assist/Cheats/DevConsole - Many games nowadays include "accessibility" options as well as assist modes, cheat codes, etc. Basically things that make the game easier than what is often viewed as the "normal play experience". We have different rules regarding these options depending on the Tier of the game. For T1 games, we simply value the games assuming they are played "as intended". For T2+ games we simply require video/screenshot proof showing these options weren't used. In cases where these features exist but they have a relatively minor impact on the challenges of the game, then they are assumed to be used to their full extent and are just valued accordingly.

- Cheating - Separate from in-game cheating. This includes any kind of file manipulation within game folders. Either editing files or copying save files in order to trivialize a challenge. As well as using any programs which can be used to unlock achievements without actually doing them, play a game in slow motion, etc. This is in general disallowed, and if you are found to have done it there may be severe consequences :tiwawa:

- Proof Requirements - for T4+ games, even if a game lacks any in-game methods of "cheating", we often require video proof of challenges when/where it is reasonable to do so. In some cases you may get partial points for having the achievements and then require proof in order to get the full value of the objective. If an objective does not specify a video/screenshot proof, then you simply need to click "update" on the website. You will be given the objective automatically if you have the achievements required.

- Guides & Puzzle Games - It goes without saying that guides can massively effect the difficulty of games and skew expected playtimes. In general, all games are valued assuming guides are used. This is necessary in order to even the playing field and simplify the process of valuing games. As a consequence, puzzle games are not currently valued on the site at all, though they do exist in their own little ecosystem here https://cedb.me/game/27578157-10b2-4f29-acee-452c2dc59477 There are cases where puzzle games are valued on the site. EX: The Witness, Portal, Braid. However these games are not valued for the puzzle solving element of the game and only for the portion of the game that can not be fully trivialized by a guide. This often includes some form of randomization or a speedrun/deathless challenge of some kind.

- "Dev-Intention" - While being obvious in the majority of cases, in all edge-cases where it isn't clear what is dev intended for the purposes of cheating or determining if something qualifies as a Primary Objective, it is left up to the mods/reps. If the objective doesn't specify, then it is probably allowed. If you aren't sure, then ask.

- CR Rating  - This is a leaderboard specific weighted point system. The formula for CR works as follows: Σ(0, n): (0.9^n)(m), where n is the ordering of your games by value (your highest game is considered the 0th highest, and no penalty is applied), and m is the value of the game. CR is calculated separately for each category. Your first person games do not affect the calculation for platformers for example. Your overall CR is the combined total of the CR for all 5 categories. The maximum amount a game can contribute to CR is 500, any game worth more than 500 points will be assumed to be worth 500 points for the rating.

- PVP challenges - Dev intended or not, we do not add dynamic or PvP related challenges to the website. Their variable nature makes them impossible to value, especially in relation to single-player challenges.
 


## Everything Else
----------------

- Potentials - Games that are possibly site worthy, but no one has gotten around to verifying yet:

- Uncleared Objectives - You may find some games with primary objectives listed as (UNCLEARED) with 1 point. These are objectives that we know exist for a game, they just haven't been cleared yet by anyone within the group and as such have not been valued. Can find a list of all Uncleared objectives in the Potentials google doc.

- Mods/Reps - Moderators interface with the website directly and moderate text/voice channels. Reps (category representatives) work with mods to handle recommendation threads for their respective categories.
