3. Ensure the key elements of your Steam profile are set to Public (see below for the three items required).  

   These settings are required for CE (or external websites in general) to access your Steam game information.  
   
   Settings can be accessed by browsing to your profile page on Steam, clicking 'Edit Profile' (top right), and selecting 'Privacy Setting' down the left-side menu.  
   Alternatively, you can browse directly there, via the following link:  
   https://steamcommunity.com/id/{USER_NAME}/edit/settings
