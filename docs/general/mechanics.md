# Site Mechanics Overview

This page brings a general summary of several terms used in the site. For more details check the "Details" group.

## Games
-------


## Points 
-------
These are meant to be a direct reflection of a games difficulty. 5 is the lowest possible value and likewise are the easiest games on the site. How this 5 point value correlates to difficulty is not really possible to describe with words, so it is easier to just list popular games that do and don't meet this threshold of difficulty.

✅ 
- Hotline Miami
- Clustertruck
- Portal
- Bastion
- Guacamelee

❌ 
- Spyro
- Borderlands
- Monster Hunter
- Undertale
- Rayman Legends

The 5 point line is a very blurry one at times, but we generally try to err on the side of rounding down rather than up when it comes to determining if a game is site worthy or not, otherwise it becomes a slippery slope. 

"Precision/Effort" are generally valued much more over "Time" when it comes to valuing a games difficulty, which is why most of the games in the ❌ category do not quite make the cut. Games like Spyro and Undertale do have a handful of somewhat challenging moments, but the vast majority of the gameplay is simply not that difficult. A game can take 30 hours to finish but be worth 0 points, another game can take 3 hours to finish and be worth 5. Time is certainly a component when trying to value a game, but it needs to be put into context of how challenging the gameplay actually is.


## Primary Objectives
--------------------
These are how a game's challenges are presented on the website and are the things you must complete in order to be awarded points. They can be a collection of specific achievements or their own goals. Some of them may require proof to be posted in ⁠proof-submission due to a lack of associated achievements or because of known exploits. They should generally be "developer-intended, recognized or encouraged" things for the player to do and try and achieve. 

Examples of things that are and aren't considered challenges within a game for the purpose of this group include...

✅ 
- Reaching the end of the game
- Achievements
- Ranks/Badges
- Collectibles
- Completing a specific mode/level
- Killing a secret boss

❌ 
- Arbitrary speedrun times
- Arbitrary death/score goals
- Mods & other "user Created Content"
- Playing with a specific combination of difficulty modifiers on (when there is no achievement or reward for doing so)
- Self imposed restrictions (Blindfolded, one-handed, DDR pad)

In other words, nothing you'll find listed as a primary objective has been made up. It all comes from the devs.

## Community Objectives & Site Achievements
----------------------------------------------
On many of the game pages you will find community objectives listed underneath the primary and secondary objectives. These award no points and are essentially all of the things that the other objectives are not. They are meant to just be bonus challenges, and outside of a handful of roles have no greater purpose or meaning as of now.

Site Achievements, rather than being game specific, act as meta objectives for the site as a whole. Achievements for achievements, basically. They can be found here: https://cedb.me/game/76574ec1-42df-4488-a511-b9f2d9290e5d
