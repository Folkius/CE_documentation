# Site Mechanics Overview

This page brings a general summary of several terms used in the site. For more details check the "Details" group.

[[toc]]

## Games
-------
Games are added to the website when they meet a certain threshold of difficulty. This threshold and the exact definition of "difficulty" are often debated and highly subjective. However there are some generally agreed upon facts. 

- #1: Difficulty is some combination of time and effort. 
- #2: Dark Souls is harder than Cookie Clicker. 

And from these truths we build our temple. üôè 

## Points 
-------
These are meant to be a direct reflection of a games difficulty. 5 is the lowest possible value and likewise are the easiest games on the site. How this 5 point value correlates to difficulty is not really possible to describe with words, so it is easier to just list popular games that do and don't meet this threshold of difficulty.

‚úÖ 
- Hotline Miami
- Clustertruck
- Portal
- Bastion
- Guacamelee

‚ùå 
- Spyro
- Borderlands
- Monster Hunter
- Undertale
- Rayman Legends

The 5 point line is a very blurry one at times, but we generally try to err on the side of rounding down rather than up when it comes to determining if a game is site worthy or not, otherwise it becomes a slippery slope. 

"Precision/Effort" are generally valued much more over "Time" when it comes to valuing a games difficulty, which is why most of the games in the ‚ùå category do not quite make the cut. Games like Spyro and Undertale do have a handful of somewhat challenging moments, but the vast majority of the gameplay is simply not that difficult. A game can take 30 hours to finish but be worth 0 points, another game can take 3 hours to finish and be worth 5. Time is certainly a component when trying to value a game, but it needs to be put into context of how challenging the gameplay actually is.


## Primary Objectives
--------------------
These are how a game's challenges are presented on the website and are the things you must complete in order to be awarded points. They can be a collection of specific achievements or their own goals. Some of them may require proof to be posted in ‚Å†proof-submission due to a lack of associated achievements or because of known exploits. They should generally be "developer-intended, recognized or encouraged" things for the player to do and try and achieve. 

Examples of things that are and aren't considered challenges within a game for the purpose of this group include...

‚úÖ 
- Reaching the end of the game
- Achievements
- Ranks/Badges
- Collectibles
- Completing a specific mode/level
- Killing a secret boss

‚ùå 
- Arbitrary speedrun times
- Arbitrary death/score goals
- Mods & other "user Created Content"
- Playing with a specific combination of difficulty modifiers on (when there is no achievement or reward for doing so)
- Self imposed restrictions (Blindfolded, one-handed, DDR pad)

In other words, nothing you'll find listed as a primary objective has been made up. It all comes from the devs.

## Community Objectives & Site Achievements
----------------------------------------------
On many of the game pages you will find community objectives listed underneath the primary and secondary objectives. These award no points and are essentially all of the things that the other objectives are not. They are meant to just be bonus challenges, and outside of a handful of roles have no greater purpose or meaning as of now.

Site Achievements, rather than being game specific, act as meta objectives for the site as a whole. Achievements for achievements, basically. They can be found here: https://cedb.me/game/76574ec1-42df-4488-a511-b9f2d9290e5d

## Categories
-----------
Categories are meant to house games of similar style and genre, of which there are currently 6.

### Platformer

EX: Super Meat Boy, Crash Bandicoot, Jump King

### Action
Heavily focuses on a sophisticated combat system, or frequent engagement with enemies and bosses. 

EX: Dark Souls, Hades, Cuphead

### Bullet Hell

### First-Person

### Strategy 
Games with a strong focus on tactical thinking.

EX: Slay the Spire, FTL: Faster Than Light, Peggle Deluxe

## Tiers
-----
In addition to category, games are also assigned a tier when added to the site. This is determined by the total point value of the game. Therefore, tiers are simply brackets of difficulty/point values.

### Tier 1 
![Tier 1](/tiers/tier1.png){width=32px height=32px} 5-15 points -- These games would be considered challenging to most players new to the genre. Genre experts would find them to be a light challenge in most cases. Games in this range typically take less than 10 hours.

### Tier 2 
![Tier 2](/tiers/tier2.png){width=32px height=32px} 20-35 points -- These games will take noticeably more effort and time than games listed in T1 for players new to the genre. Genre experts may struggle on some aspects. Games in this range typically take between 10-20 hours.

### Tier 3
![Tier 3](/tiers/tier3.png){width=32px height=32px} 40-75 points -- Players new to the genre will find these games to be brutal. Genre experts will find these games to be the perfect balance of difficulty for their skillset. Games in this range typically take between 20-50 hours.

### Tier 4
![Tier 4](/tiers/tier4.png){width=32px height=32px} 80-195 points -- These games will require a substantial amount of time and effort even for genre experts. Games in this range typically take between 50-100 hours.

### Tier 5
![Tier 5](/tiers/tier5.png){width=32px height=32px} 200-395 points -- Near the apex of challenging games. Players new to the genre will interpret these games to be nearly impossible without insane amounts of dedication and time. Genre experts will find them to be brutal and not worth the time investment or effort in some cases. An average completion time below 100 hours for a T5 game should be exceedingly rare without extenuating circumstances.

### Tier 6
![Tier 6](/tiers/tier6.png){width=32px height=32px} 400-795 points -- Extremely hard games. Without extreme dedication, you may not be able to conquer them at all. Games in this category can start taking from 200 hours onwards to clear.

### Tier 7 
![Tier 7](/tiers/tier7.png){width=32px height=32px} 800+ points -- Being above and beyond the apex, these games will demand and monopolize your life for an extended period of time. They tend to take more than 700 hours on average. If you beat one of them, you will surely come out of it being a different person...?

## Meaning of hours

The hours listed above are not rules but rather general guidelines and averages. In particular, Tier 6 and Tier 7 games have a scalar penalty applied to them where the amount of points that can be earned slowly decreases the higher an amount of hours is required. This is to balance them with games in a lower tier.

Hours in this sense are defined as *the amount of time spent specifically working towards the challenging aspects of the game*; the elements associated with casual playthroughs, idling, grinds, or other non-challenge related content are only partially considered, depending on how they expose you to the core mechanics and/or commiting the game to memory. The average times are also typically only considered for group members, or those who engage with challenging content often.
