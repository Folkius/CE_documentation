# Introduction

Welcome! We're a group that focuses on identifying and completing challenging content within video games, primarily from Steam and retro consoles.

Whilst there are some parallels with achievement hunting, the scope of challenging content in a game may only be a subset of a game's achievements, or may not be captured by achievements at all.

Complete challenges, earn points, gain ranks/roles, participate in events, find and share new games.

These documents serve as an explanation of our rules and our logic to determine what is added or not.

## How do I submit proof??
<s>Because this is the most asked question</s>

There's no method of adding proof via the site as of present. You're required to join the Discord server or contact a staff member. Here are the ideal steps:
::: warning
**A Steam account is required for your profile to appear on our site.** We don't support other login methods for the time being.
:::
::: info STEPS
- [Make your Steam details public](/isolated/how-to-set-steam-to-public) and login to the website https://cedb.me/
- - If you already logged in before making your details public, you can force a profile update via the top-right menu.
- - Your games may take some minutes before appearing, and your achievements some hours.
- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/challengeenthusiast).
- Post a link to your website profile in the server's landing pad (```#landing-pad```, where your join message is) to confirm your identity.
- Once you're approved (may take hours), go to the ```#proof-submission``` channel and follow the steps there.

## Using the Website

### Updating Games
Once you are logged into the website, at any time you can click "update" in the top right menu. This will "re-sync" your account and scan your Steam and RetroAchievements profiles for new achievements and games.

If you want "family shared" Steam games to appear in your game list they need to be in your "recently played" list on Steam (played in the last 2 weeks), which means you will need to relaunch in Steam the games you want added to your CE profile, and then click "update" on the website again. 

### Submitting proof 
For objectives that have no associated achievements, or which ask for video/screenshot proof, submitting the relevant proof can be done in ‚Å†```proof-submission```.
Post the name of the game, the objective, a link to your CE profile, and the required proof.

A mod will add the objective to your profile once they get a chance, and if everything is okay they will "react" to your proof-message to signal that it has been done.

An example of a proof submission is outlined below:
![Proof submission example](/pages/proof_submission_example.png)

::: tip 
Before submitting proof, make sure you update your profile on the website and that the game in question is showing in your game list. If it isn't on your game list, we can't add the objective for you. Try relaunching the game and reupdating as a troubleshooting method before messaging a mod for assistance.

### Languages
The site overlay supports multiple languages thanks to our community effort. 

Please note that objectives are not translated and there is no plan to implement translations on them. When in doubt, ask a community member.

### Linking your profile with RetroAchievements
To add a [RetroAchievements (RA)] (https://retroachievements.org/) profile to your CE profile, browse to "Settings" in your profile dropdown (top-right of the CE website).

There is a field where you can enter the your RA account's username; once entered, click the "Verify" button.

A verification popup message will appear, requesting you enter a specific string of characters to your RA profile's 'motto'.

A link to the RA user settings page is available here: [RA Settings] (https://retroachievements.org/settings))
Once the string of characters has been entered in the Motto field, click "Update" on the RA Settings page.
![RA verification Part Two](/pages/RA_verification2.png)

After this update has been made to your RA userpage, click 'Verify' on the account verification popup on the CE website.

You are free to remove/revert/change your motto once this step has been completed.
