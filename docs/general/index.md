# Introduction

Welcome! We're a group that focuses on identifying and completing challenging content within video games, primarily from Steam and retro consoles.

The goal of the group is to bring like-minded challenge-oriented gamers together. The website acts as a database of games that meet a minimum threshold of difficulty, and orders them based on that difficulty.

Whilst there are some parallels with achievement hunting, the scope of challenging content in a game may only be a subset of a game's achievements, or may not be captured by achievements at all.

Complete challenges, earn points, gain ranks/roles, participate in events, find and share new games.

This wiki page aims to document our rules, the core site mechanics and features, and the logic/approach to determining what games are added to the site.
