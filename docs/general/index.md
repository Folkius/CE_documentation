# Introduction

Welcome! We're a group centered around challenges within video games in Steam and retro consoles.

Think of it like achievement hunting, but more refined, and with a slightly broader scope. Complete challenges, earn points, gain ranks/roles, participate in events, find and share new games.

These documents serve as an explanation of our rules and our logic to determine what is added or not.

## How do I submit proof??
<s>Because this is the most asked question</s>

There's no method of adding proof via the site as of present. You're required to join the Discord server or contact a staff member. Here are the ideal steps:
::: warning
**A Steam account is required for your profile to appear on our site.** We don't support other login methods for the time being.
:::
::: info STEPS
- [Make your Steam details public](/isolated/how-to-set-steam-to-public) and login to the website https://cedb.me/
- - If you already logged in before making your details public, you can force a profile update via the top-right menu.
- - Your games may take some minutes before appearing, and your achievements some hours.
- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/challengeenthusiast).
- Post a link to your website profile in the server's landing pad (```#landing-pad```, where your join message is) to confirm your identity.
- Once you're approved (may take hours), go to the ```#proof-submission``` channel and follow the steps there.

## Using the Website

### Updating Games
Once you are logged into the website, at any time you can click "update" in the top right menu. This will "re-sync" your account and scan your Steam profile for new achievements and games. If you want "family shared" games to appear in your game list they need to be in your "recently played" list on Steam (played in the last 2 weeks), which means you just need to relaunch the games you want added, close them, and then click update on the website again. 

### Submitting proof 
For objectives that have no associated achievements or ask for video/screenshot proof, that can be done in ‚Å†```proof-submission```. Just post the name of the game, the objective, and a link to your profile. A mod will add the objective to your profile once they get a chance, and if everything is okay they will "react" to your proof-message to signal that it has been done.

::: tip 
Before submitting proof, make sure you update your profile on the website and that the game in question is showing in your game list. If it isn't on your game list, we can't add the objective for you. Try relaunching the game and reupdating as a troubleshooting method before messaging a mod for assistance.

### Languages
The site overlay supports multiple languages thanks to our community effort. 

Please note that objectives are not translated and there is no plan to implement translations on them. When in doubt, ask a community member.
