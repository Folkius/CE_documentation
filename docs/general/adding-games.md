# Game additions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We use a system of forum posts to add new games to our database or make changes to them. These suggestions are managed through our Discord server.

Anyone C rank and above can make recommendation posts. It is very difficult to be able to give game values when you lack enough reference points, which is why we require C rank. Thread discussions, however, are open to everyone, and when making a thread for anything you should be prepared for this. 

Not everyone is going to always agree with your suggestions or assessment of a games difficulty. It is ultimately up to the mods/reps what happens with recommendations and they will more than likely ask you several clarifying questions before making a decision, as well as pinging other people who may have also played the game in the group, referencing clear times of other people, etc.
