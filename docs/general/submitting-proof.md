# How do I submit proof?

The most commonly asked question!

For objectives that have no associated achievements, or which ask for video/screenshot proof, submitting the relevant proof can be done in ⁠```#proof-submission``` in our Discord server.

There is <u>no method of adding proof via the site</u> as at the time of this document's writing.

::: tip INFO REQUIRED
Post the name of the game, the objective, a link to your CE profile, and the required proof.
:::

An example of a proof submission is outlined below:
![Proof submission example](/pages/proof_submission_example.png)

A mod will add the objective to your profile once they get a chance, and if everything is okay they will "react" to your proof-message to signal that it has been done.

It may take time before your proof is accepted/added to your profile. Please bear with us; the mod team are only human!

::: tip 
Before submitting proof, make sure you update your profile on the website and that the game in question is showing in your game list.

If it isn't on your game list, we can't add the objective for you.

Try relaunching the game and re-updating as a troubleshooting method before messaging a mod for assistance.
