# Contacting CE staff - The Ticket system

The CE Discord utilises a Ticket Tool for communication with CE staff, which can be found in the ```#support``` channel of the Discord server.

The general purpose of the Ticket Tool is to enable a private (but not anonymous) conversation on matters that warrant it. This includes, but is not limited to:
- reports of potential cheating
- reports of behaviour leading to uncomfortable situations
- private suggestions (e.g.: general feedback, ideas for events, recognition for users etc) 

A formal document that details the guidelines for use, and general process that will be followed, is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-SWjfQD6SkziLagPbbPwL8fX8Qtvr-S3MMSVlfGHAs0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q6dnae6scq4e).  
It is also linked in the Ticket Tool interaction box (see screenshot in the next section).

## Using the Ticket Tool

Accessing the ```#support``` channel in the CE Discord presents the following menu:

![Ticket01](/tickets/Ticket01.png)

Do note the text in the Tool's message box, which includes a link to the guidelines document (content detailed on this page, and also linked above).

Clicking the button enables one of two different tickets to be raised:
- With both the moderator and admin teams
- With only the admin team

![Ticket02](/tickets/Ticket02.png)

Once you've made your selection, you will receive a pop-up box much like the following, which will provide you with the opportunity to give some context for your ticket.

![Ticket03](/tickets/Ticket03.png)

After clicking 'submit', a private channel will be created where the relevant parties (the ticket creator, and the group of staff selected at the outset) can converse on the matter being raised.

An example of such an interaction is set out below.

## Ticket Tool guidelines

The below sections replicate the contents of the guidelines document (as linked above) to ensure the content readily available / visible for users.

## 1. General information

If the user wants a quick read of what to know / expect before opening a ticket, reading this chapter should suffice.

### 1.1 Purpose

**1.1.1 Purpose of the ticket system**

The integration of the ticket system serves to create controlled environments dedicated to discussing ***complaints, accusations or any other type of required conversation*** without the risk of the discourse being disturbed by misinformation or disrespectful behavior.

It furthermore serves to organize and preserve information provided for future use by the staff, if needed, as opposed to discourse taking place across several separate channels or DM conversations.

**1.1.2 Purpose of the ticketing/reporting guidelines**

In addition to the integration of the ticket system, guidelines for the processing of reports are also defined.

This serves to give the accusers, the accused and staff members an orientation on how the matter they’re involved in should be handled.

These guidelines are not binding. However, their adherence is very much recommended for the sake of establishing and maintaining order, clarity and trust.

### 1.2 Code of conduct

This section describes behavioral rules that should be followed.

**1.2.1 Screencaps / message quotation**

Taking screen caps or copying messages either from the thread or DM channels and sharing these outside of the channel of origin is not allowed unless all participants of the thread or both sides of a DM channel agree to it. Staff members are not exempt from this restriction.

**1.2.2 Secrecy**

For normal suggestion tickets, this subsection may not apply as strongly.

In the context of suspicions of cheating, staff may mention that a cheat report is being processed if the subject matter comes up. However, they may not state any details on its proceedings or speculations on the possible outcome and consequences. The provided assurance that the matter is being handled shall serve as a justification that further discussion of the matter within channels moderated by staff may be prohibited.

However, the mention of any cheat report having been submitted or being processed is prohibited. The anonymity of those who submit a cheat report is to be protected as much as reasonably possible.

Additionally, those who submit a server report are also subjected to such anonymity if the situation deems so.

**1.2.3 Behaviour**

For the sake of a better conversation, the misuse or excess use of emojis, stickers and GIFs to express a reaction to any messages is not suggested, unless part of a quote that fits within context.

Likewise, the text messages written by any party should try to not fall too much into the use of big fallacies that could harm someone.

The members involved should not hurry for a solution, for life is complicated and time is not very available sometimes.

Failure to comply with this could mean an early closure of the ticket or removal from the ticket. 

### 1.3 Notes

Once closed and the subject dealt with and a period of time passes, the ticket will be transcribed for archival for the mod staff only unless its contents are deemed too sensitive to keep within the channels of the server.

Tickets may be handled at their own pace.

## 2. Cheat reports

Cheat reports include insights into the potential doubt of the validity of proof submission of a member of the server, or the related achievements of any objective.

### 2.1 Submitting a report

With the integration of the ticket system, cheat reports are to be submitted via the ticket system if possible, since this will be the official way to handle these situations.

### 2.2 Involved parties

**2.2.1 Accuser**

The accuser is the person who opens the ticket and brings the subject into the table.

If the accuser is a mod or category representative, they will not function as a mod or rep within the context of the processing of the report.

**2.2.2 Accused**
The accused is the subject of the accusation and is incentivized to respond to it, once they are added to the conversation. Their participation, based on their preference, may either be in the form of being added to the thread or by having one mod or category rep act as a mediator between them and the thread.

If the accused is a moderator or a category representative, they will not serve as such within the processing of the report.

**2.2.3 Mods and category reps**

Mods and representatives of the relevant category serve to process the cheat report from start to finish while keeping the discourse clean. In the context of cheat reports, they have an equal say.

The participating mods or reps are initially decided by the accuser. However, the mods or reps may add additional staff members to process the report, if necessary.

**2.2.4 Game experts**

Additional experts on the relevant game(s) may be added to the thread to add more insight and dispel misinformation. These are added to the thread by the mods or reps. Accusers and accused may ask for them to be added.

**2.2.5 Mediator**

If the accused decides against joining the thread, they may still participate in the discourse through a mediator. This mediator is a mod or rep who is tasked with communicating between the thread and the accused and present their points of view in an unmistakable manner.

However, even the mediator has to adhere to the Codes of Conduct, meaning that they shall not share screen caps or quotations of messages without the agreement of all involved.

### 2.3 Process

**2.3.1 Accusation**

[Accuser explains accusation]

**2.3.2 Rebuttal**

[Accused gets notified and involved and may counter argue]

**2.3.3 Decision**

[The staff thinks about it and comes to a conclusion]

### 2.4 Possible consequences

**2.4.1 No consequence**

If the evidence against the accused is insufficient or all anomalies have been accounted for, no consequence is enforced.

**2.4.2 Warning**

If the evidence against the accused is insufficient but the behavior of the accused still raises concerns they may receive a warning. This warning may be used against them in a future cheat report issued against them.

**2.4.3 Proof invalidation**

If the evidence against the accused suggests that the proof provided by the accused for an objective is insufficient, their proof may be invalidated and the objective unawarded.

**2.4.4 Leaderboard disqualification**

If the evidence against the accused suggests that the accused is entirely untrustworthy, they shall be disqualified from the leaderboard and their server rank is reduced to E.

Furthermore, a member disqualified from the leaderboard shall not be allowed to continue acting as a category representative if they were one.

**2.4.5 Server ban**

If the previous conditions against the accused meet and it’s a repeated situation OR the amount of breach of trust is too big to consider them a fitting player of challenging games, they shall be disqualified from the leaderboard and removed from the server.

Furthermore, a member banned in this way may not come back for an extended period of time

## 3. Server reports

Server reports include reports on the behavior of other server members.

### 3.1 Submitting a report

With the integration of the ticket system, server reports now possess an official avenue of submission.

Unlike cheat reports, it’s not mandatory for a server report to be submitted via a ticket if the subject matter is deemed too sensitive. However, if the notified staff moderator does not deem the subject matter as too sensitive, they may ask the accuser to submit their report via a ticket instead for further discussion.

### 3.2 Involved parties

**3.2.1 Accuser**

The accuser is the person who opens the ticket and brings the subject into the table.

If the accuser is a mod or category rep, they will not function as a mod or rep within the context of the processing of the report.

Unlike with cheat reports, the accuser issuing a server report is allowed to ask for the thread to be deleted at any point during and after the processing of the report. If done so, the thread must be deleted. Furthermore, server reports as a whole do not have to be submitted in a ticket if the accuser feels it won’t work.

**3.2.2 Accused**

The accused is the subject of the accusation. Due to the potentially sensitive nature of server reports, the accused is not allowed to participate in the conversation by being added to the thread, unless all accusers and staff members unanimously are in favor of it. By default, one of the staff members will act as a mediator between the thread and the accused.

**3.2.3 Mods**

Mods serve to process the server report from start to finish while keeping the discourse clean. Category representatives usually do not get to see these kind of reports.

Initially all the mod staff participates or gets a chance to see the ticket. However, the staff may add/remove additional members to process the report, if necessary.

**3.2.4 Mediator**

If the accused is not added to the thread, they may still participate in the discourse through a mediator. This mediator is a mod who is tasked with communicating between the thread and the accused and present their points of view in an unmistakable manner.

However, even the mediator has to adhere to the Codes of Conduct, meaning that they shall not share screen caps or quotations of messages without the agreement of all involved.

### 3.3 Process

The general process has yet to be detailed, but it would generally involve time, many questions being asked and an opportunity for any party to speak to their heart’s content.

After enough information is recompiled, the staff team will come up with a conclusion and announce it to all parties.

### 3.4 Possible consequences

**3.4.1 No consequence**

If the accusers and the accused come to an understanding or none of the following consequences seem appropriate, no consequence is enforced.

Additionally, the thread will be deleted.

**3.4.2 Warning**

If the staff deems the circumstances surrounding the accused not critical enough to enforce bigger consequences but also not worth ignoring, the accused may come off with a warning.

There is no set limit after which it becomes a bigger consequence, but it essentially means that their behavior needs to get better.

Additionally, the thread will be archived if allowed.

**3.4.3 Quarantine**

If the staff deems the circumstances surrounding the accused critical enough to take action, the accused will be quarantined (read: Q rank) and unable to engage with text messages for a set amount of time. Voice engaging is still allowed on limited channels.

This usually comes with validation enough for a ban if enough further incidents happen.

Additionally, the thread will be archived if allowed.

**3.4.4 Unmodding**

Special subsection: if the staff deems the circumstances surrounding a staff-related accused critical enough to take action, the accused will be stripped of its mod or rep permissions in any component of the site, server or Steam channel, along with any other consequences.

Additionally, the thread will be archived if allowed.

**3.4.5 Ban**

If the staff deems the circumstances surrounding the accused way too heavy to let them remain on the server, the accused will be banned immediately when the decision is made. This ban is usually long-time or permanent and may not be argued against, with very rare exceptions being made.

Additionally, the thread will be archived if allowed.

## 4. Suggestions

If needing to engage with the staff for private suggestions (for example, something to award to the server, secret ideas of events or just general feedback), a more relaxed ticket is allowed to be created.

It’s very likely that upon conclusion, the ticket will be transcribed and its channel deleted.
