# Effort scalars (points per hour, or PPH)

The list is not final - an initial guidance taken from this post:

Single large yolos - approx 2.5-3 pph.

Cluster of shorter yolos - approx 1.5-2.5 pph but really depends on a huge number of other factors.

IL speedruns / very high execution - approx 1-1.5 pph.

IL challenges / other - approx 0.5-1.5 pph, but again, really depends on a huge number of other factors.

For the strategy category, take the above multipliers and divide them all by 2 for the same kinds of challenges.


These are the scalar baselines that have been used in the past, but they get adjusted by various amounts depending on more information
These numbers were taken from a really long analysis undertaken on all games cleared by group members about 3-4 years ago.
Most games fell within a range, and were more confidently within a tighter range based on challenge type.
