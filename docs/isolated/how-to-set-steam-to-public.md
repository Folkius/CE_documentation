# How to set Steam details to public


## Video walkthrough
<video controls="controls" width=640 height=360 src="/pages/public_details_walkthrough.mp4"></video>

## Text walkthrough

- Go to your Steam profile.
- Go to the top right, below your level or your highlighted badge, and click the "Edit Profile" button.
- Select "Privacy Settings" in the new menu that will appear.
- Set "My Profile" and "Game details" both to public, and DO NOT check the block under game details.

Now you can safely press the update button on our site, or trigger a manual game sync.

## FAQ

### Why do I have to do this?
Because Steam is very serious about privacy, and we external sites can't access your data without those options enabled, even after logging in.

### Can I undo these changes?
Yes, once you're confident the site has grabbed every game and achievement you care about. (Achievements take slightly longer than games to sync)

### I have a game that's not appearing.
There are 3 possible causes here:
- You didn't follow the above steps properly. Try opening your profile in incognito and checking your games list to confirm.
- You're trying to sync a family shared game. You must have opened it in the last two weeks for us to be able to grab it, again, due to Steam's quirks with family shared games. (Since they are not "yours", so to say).
- You're trying to sync a **private** game. This is never something that happens automatically, you must have done this before and forgot. Go to the game's library page, open its settings -> Manage -> Unmark as Private.
