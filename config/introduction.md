# Introduction


## Games
-------
Games are added to the website when they meet a certain threshold of difficulty. This threshold and the exact definition of "difficulty" are often debated and highly subjective. However there are some generally agreed upon facts. 

- #1: Difficulty is some combination of time and effort. 
- #2: Dark Souls is harder than cookie clicker. 

And from these truths we build our temple üôè 

## Points 
-------
These are meant to be a direct reflection of a games difficulty. 5 is the lowest possible value and likewise are the easiest games on the site. How this 5 point value correlates to difficulty is not really possible to describe with words, so it is easier to just list popular games that do and don't meet this threshold of difficulty.

‚úÖ 
- Hotline Miami
- Clustertruck
- Portal
- Bastion
- Guacamelee

‚ùå 
- Spyro
- Borderlands
- Monster Hunter
- Undertale
- Rayman Legends

The 5 point line is a very blurry one at times, but we generally try to err on the side of rounding down rather than up when it comes to determining if a game is site worthy or not, otherwise it becomes a slippery slope. "Precision/Effort" are generally valued much more over "Time" when it comes to valuing a games difficulty. Which is why most of the games in the ‚ùå category do not quite make the cut. Games like Spyro and Undertale do have a handful of of somewhat challenging moments, but the vast majority of the gameplay is simply not that difficult. A game can take 30 hours to finish but be worth 0 points, a game can take 3 hours to finish and be worth 5. Time is certainly a component when trying to value a game, but it needs to be put into context of how challenging the gameplay actually is.


## Primary Objectives
--------------------
These are how a games challenges are presented on the website and are the things you must complete in order to be awarded points. They are most often a collection of specific achievements. Some of them may require proof to be posted in ‚Å†proof-submission due to a lack of associated achievements or because of known exploits. They should generally be "developer-intended" things for the player to do and try and achieve. Examples of things that are and aren't considered challenges within a game for the purpose of this group...

‚úÖ 
- Reaching the end of the game
- Achievements
- Ranks/Badges
- Collectibles
- Completing a specific mode/level
- Killing a secret boss

‚ùå 
- Arbitrary speedrun times
- Arbitrary death/score goals
- Mods & other "User Created Content"
- Playing with a specific combination of difficulty modifiers on (when there is no achievement or reward for doing so)
- Self imposed restrictions (Blindfolded, 1 handed, DDR pad)

## Community Objectives & Site Achievements
----------------------------------------------
On many of the game pages you will find community objectives listed underneath the primary objectives. These award no points and are essentially all of the things that Primary Objectives are not. They are meant to just be bonus challenges, and outside of a handful of roles have no greater purpose or meaning as of now.

Site Achievements can be found here: https://cedb.me/game/76574ec1-42df-4488-a511-b9f2d9290e5d

Similar to community objectives they are just for fun and award no score. However rather than being game specific, they act as meta objectives for the site as a whole. Achievements for achievements, basically. 


## Categories
-----------
Categories are meant to house games of similar style and genre, of which there are currently 6.

### Platformer - Primary element of gameplay is precisely maneuvering your way through a kind of obstacle course.
EX: Super Meat Boy, Crash Bandicoot, Jump King

### Action - Heavily focuses on a sophisticated combat system, or frequent engagement with enemies and bosses. 
EX: Dark Souls, Hades, Cuphead

### Bullet Hell - Games where avoidance of large amounts of projectiles or moving hazards is the most relevant aspect of the game. 
EX: Touhou(series), Geometry Wars 3, Monolith

### First-Person - Games from the first person perspective, including VR games. 
EX: Doom Eternal, Neon White, Devil Daggers

### Arcade - Games with a focus on reflex or score attack, though also includes everything else that isn't covered by the other categories.
EX: Super Hexagon, OlliOlli, Surgeon Simulator

### Strategy - Games with a strong focus on tactical thinking.
EX: Slay the Spire, FTL: Faster Than Light, Peggle Deluxe

## Tiers
-----
In addition to category, games are also assigned a tier when added to the site. Tiers are simply brackets of difficulty/point values.

:tier1: 5-15 -- These games would be considered challenging to most players new to the genre. Genre experts would find them to be a light challenge in most cases. Games in this range typically take less than 10 hours.

:tier2: 20-35 -- These games will take noticeably more effort and time than games listed in T1 for players new to the genre. Genre experts may struggle on some aspects. Games in this range typically take between 10-20 hours.

:tier3: 40-75 -- Players new to the genre will find these games to be brutal. Genre experts will find these games to be the perfect balance of difficulty for their skillset. Games in this range typically take between 20-50 hours.

:tier4: 80-195 -- These games will require a substantial amount of time and effort even for genre experts. Games in this range typically take between 50-100 hours.

:tier5: 200+ -- The apex of challenging games, and encompasses anything listed higher than 195 points. Players new to the genre will interpret these games to be nearly impossible without insane amounts of dedication and time. Genre experts will find them to be brutal and not worth the time investment or effort in some cases. An average completion time below 100 hours for a T5 game should be exceedingly rare without extenuating circumstances.

(The hours listed are not rules, they are general guidelines and averages)

## Recommendations: How things are added/changed on the site
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Game additions/changes are suggested through here ‚Å†recommendations
We currently go through a cycle of open/closed recommendations in order to give mods enough time to work through the threads.

Anyone C rank and above can make recommendation posts. It is very difficult to be able to give game values when you lack enough reference points, which is why we require C rank. Thread discussions however are open to everyone, and when making a thread for anything you should be prepared for this. Not everyone is going to always agree with your suggestions or assessment of a games difficulty. It is ultimately up to the mods/reps what happens with recommendations and they will more than likely ask you several clarifying questions before making a decision, as well as pinging other people who may have also played the game in the group, referencing clear times of other people, etc. 


## Edge-Cases, Exceptions, etc
-----------------------------
As you would expect with a system that is based around so many subjective things, things aren't always as clean-cut as one might like.

- Assist/Cheats/DevConsole - Many games nowadays include "accessibility" options as well as assist modes, cheat codes, etc. Basically things that make the game easier than what is often viewed as the "normal play experience". We have different rules regarding these options depending on the Tier of the game. For T1 games, we simply value the games assuming they are played "as intended". For T2+ games we simply require video/screenshot proof showing these options weren't used. In cases where these features exist but they have a relatively minor impact on the challenges of the game, then they are assumed to be used to their full extent and are just valued accordingly.

- Cheating - Separate from in-game cheating. This includes any kind of file manipulation within game folders. Either editing files or copying save files in order to trivialize a challenge. As well as using any programs which can be used to unlock achievements without actually doing them, play a game in slow motion, etc. This is in general disallowed, and if you are found to have done it there may be severe consequences :tiwawa:

- Proof Requirements - for T4+ games, even if a game lacks any in-game methods of "cheating", we often require video proof of challenges when/where it is reasonable to do so. In some cases you may get partial points for having the achievements and then require proof in order to get the full value of the objective. If an objective does not specify a video/screenshot proof, then you simply need to click "update" on the website. You will be given the objective automatically if you have the achievements required.

- Guides & Puzzle Games - It goes without saying that guides can massively effect the difficulty of games and skew expected playtimes. In general, all games are valued assuming guides are used. This is necessary in order to even the playing field and simplify the process of valuing games. As a consequence, puzzle games are not currently valued on the site at all, though they do exist in their own little ecosystem here https://cedb.me/game/27578157-10b2-4f29-acee-452c2dc59477 There are cases where puzzle games are valued on the site. EX: The Witness, Portal, Braid. However these games are not valued for the puzzle solving element of the game and only for the portion of the game that can not be fully trivialized by a guide. This often includes some form of randomization or a speedrun/deathless challenge of some kind.

- "Dev-Intention" - While being obvious in the majority of cases, in all edge-cases where it isn't clear what is dev intended for the purposes of cheating or determining if something qualifies as a Primary Objective, it is left up to the mods/reps. If the objective doesn't specify, then it is probably allowed. If you aren't sure, then ask.

- CR Rating  - This is a leaderboard specific weighted point system. The formula for CR works as follows: Œ£(0, n): (0.9^n)(m), where n is the ordering of your games by value (your highest game is considered the 0th highest, and no penalty is applied), and m is the value of the game. CR is calculated separately for each category. Your first person games do not affect the calculation for platformers for example. Your overall CR is the combined total of the CR for all 5 categories. The maximum amount a game can contribute to CR is 500, any game worth more than 500 points will be assumed to be worth 500 points for the rating.

- PVP challenges - Dev intended or not, we do not add dynamic or PvP related challenges to the website. Their variable nature makes them impossible to value, especially in relation to single-player challenges.
 


## Everything Else
----------------

- Potentials - Games that are possibly site worthy, but no one has gotten around to verifying yet: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NeWYzeRi7NDrm9jvJKZgjrB6LLSjKskD3yNO0SYOVpk/edit#gid=1693629618

- Uncleared Objectives - You may find some games with primary objectives listed as (UNCLEARED) with 0 points. These are objectives that we know exist for a game, they just haven't been cleared yet by anyone within the group and as such have not been valued. Can find a list of all Uncleared objectives in the Potentials google doc.

- Mods/Reps - Moderators interface with the website directly and moderate text/voice channels. Reps (category representatives) work with mods to handle recommendation threads for their respective categories.

- Casino - ‚Å†casino

- Game Keys - List of keys we have available to hand out as rewards for events and other stuff
